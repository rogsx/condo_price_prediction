# Condo Price Prediction in Toronto
### 1.0 Introduction
The prices of condominiums have increased significantly in Toronto
over the last few years as a combination of higher interest rates, 
foreign buyers tax, and more stringent stress tests have pushed the 
demand for condos higher. 

In order for the buyers to make informed choices about their real estate 
investment, more transparency in data is required. Now that the TREB 
has to allow real estate brokerage to publish sold data of residential 
real estate, there are numerous sites such as HouseSigma that make these 
data available to their registered users for free. 

Some sites attempts to predict the sold prices of a property by analysing 
historical sales prices of similar properties through the use of machine learning
techniques. These prediction models are not always accurate due to various
reasons. 

This project attempts to predict the listing prices of a particular property, using 
some of the similar approaches that would be applied in predicting
final sales price. By predicting the listing price, it aims to serve as a reference
point for buyers to assess the fairness of the asking price. 

### 2.0 Problem Definition
Goal of the project is to predict the listing prices of a condo unit, based on its 
physical characteristics, location, and neighbourhood data. 

### 3.0 Methodologies
Data is collected from openly accessable sources. A sample set is provided under the 
sample_data directory.
